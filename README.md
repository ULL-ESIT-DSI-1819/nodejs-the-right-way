# Notes

## node-harmony

The shebang line ```#!/usr/bin/env node --harmony``` works on MacOS, but not on Ubuntu. As a workaround, you can use a wrapper script like ```node-harmony``` in this repository. Just place it in your path (e.g., ```/usr/local/bin/```) and use the shebang line ```#!/usr/bin/env node-harmony```.
